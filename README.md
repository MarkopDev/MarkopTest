Markop Test is a free, open-source, focused testing tool for the ASP.NET framework.

## Integration Test
A part of software testing that tests individual code components to validate interactions among different software system modules. \
We use these tests are used to test the app's infrastructure and the whole framework, often including the following components:
- Database
- File system
- Request-response pipeline

Markop provides an app factory abstraction to make it easy to implement a **clean** integration test and view output instead of using external API testing tools such as Postman.

#### Usage
- TODO

## Functional Test
The test determines the product's functionality that can be done by aggregating integration tests and comparing the actual output with the predetermined output. \
We use case scenarios for functional testing. For example, in a news system, we must test managing news scenarios such as **Create**, **Edit** and **Delete** news entity, you can implement transaction workflow in your system. \
As in the integration testing, Markop provides an app factory abstraction to make it easy to implement a **clean** functional test.
